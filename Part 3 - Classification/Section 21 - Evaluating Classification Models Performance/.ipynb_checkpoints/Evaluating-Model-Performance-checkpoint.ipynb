    "False positive occurs when the classifier classifies it as positive or it answers our question as positive but is actually false. False negative is when it predicts it as false but is actually true. The number of false negatives and false positives can be very useful in determining the efficiency of our model. Their sum refers to the total number of wrongly predicted data. However, both of them carry different magnitudes of risks. In most cases, a false negative is supposed to be more dangerous than a false positive. But, in other cases like the medical field both the false positive and false negative can be equally dangerous."
